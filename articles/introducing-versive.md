### **The problem**

Most companies don't speak to their users enough, especially as they scale. As a result, it's difficult to make informed product and marketing decisions.

In my past life as a product manager and designer, I conducted dozens of user studies at startups and public companies. Each time, it took weeks of scheduling, interviewing, and synthesizing to get from questions to answers. As a result, my teams collected feedback and validated ideas far less than they would have liked.

Existing tools don't solve this problem well. Interviews and focus groups are time-consuming and expensive to set up. Surveys only yield surface-level insights and are cumbersome to build. Even at companies with dedicated research teams, few requests get approved, leaving most PMs, designers, and marketers on their own.

### **The solution**

Versive enables teams to collect interview-level insights at the scale and speed of a survey. We support voice interviews, dozens of languages, concept and design testing, structured questions, branding customization, and more.

1. Build your survey in Versive, or ask our AI assistant to generate one in seconds.

2. Our AI moderator administers your survey and asks intelligent follow-up questions to dig deeper into user responses.

3. We'll auto-generate summaries and insights, plus give you transcripts for each response.
